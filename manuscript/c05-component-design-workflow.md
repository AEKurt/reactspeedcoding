# Component Design Workflow

Components are central to coding and thinking in React. In this chapter we will
focus as much on the "thinking in components" as we do coding for more components
in our Speed UI framework.

We will develop a workflow for designing React components and component hierarchy
step-by-step, considering decisions along the way.

The high level workflow we will develop in this chapter is broken down into following four stages.

1. **Starting** React component design.
2. **Defining** component internals.
3. **Wiring** up component hierarchy.
4. **Refactoring** existing components.

## Starting React component design (S)

If the blank, dark code editor window is staring back at you, do not despair. We will run through 10
different ways you can get started building your components in React!

## Sample to React (Ss)

You may want to start with an existing single page sample
available on Github or on one of the tutorial websites. Normally this is accompanied
with JSFiddle or similar tools where you can play around with the functionality,
before deciding to bring the code into React.

## Embed to React (Se)

Many web platforms like Youtube, Flickr, and Twitter offer embed APIs to easily
integrate their platform features into your app.

## API to React (Sa)

You may want to integrate an existing API from the multitude of web service providers.

## Wireframe to React (Sw)

Start your React component creation journey with a simple wireframe.

## Mock to React (Sm)

You may have designed a mock for your app using tools like Sketch.

## Prototype to React (Sp)

Rapid prototyping tools take mocks a step further by building interactivity.

## Data table to React (St)

Sometimes you may have a dataset that you want to design into a component.

## Real-time stream to React (Sr)

Real-time streams of data like Twitter feeds, app instrumentation data, device sensor information,
can be thought about as a React component.

## Document to React (Sd)

Are you interested in representing a work document, report, or template as a
React component?

## HTML elements to React (Sh)

Do you want to add more capabilities to HTML markup elements? React can help.

## Defining component internals (D)
