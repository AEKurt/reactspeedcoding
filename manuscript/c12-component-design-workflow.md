# Component Design Workflow

Our component design workflow, from prior chapters, defines seven high level stages.

1. **Start** component design.
2. **Define** component internals.
3. **Wire** multiple components.
4. **Route** component layouts.
5. **Refactor** existing components.
6. **Test** app components.
7. **Redux** state container.

We can form a **Periodic Table** of React Component Design workflow. This infographic serves
few objectives.

- It organizes the entire React component design workflow in one place.
- Serves as a memory aid using symbols to represent workflow stages and strategies.
- The numbers are indicative of steps necessary to achieve a strategy.
- Sequence of the stages from left to right indicate the ideal development workflow.
- Higher order strategies (at the top) normally link to next stage in the workflow.
- Provides a linear learning path to almost entire React ecosystem.
