# Component Design Workflow

Our component design workflow, from prior chapters, defines seven high level stages.

1. **Start** component design.
2. **Define** component internals.
3. **Wire** multiple components.
4. **Route** component layouts.
5. **Refactor** existing components.
6. **Test** app components.
7. **Redux** state container.
